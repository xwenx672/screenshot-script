Trim history cap. Integer refers to lines in the th file. Set to anything above 0. trimhistory.th will be trimmed on start of script.
trimhistorycap:5000

Lag compensation value.
This setting changes how the script deals with lag, depending on the set value, it will increase lag handling by slowing 
the script more and sooner (lower value of no less than 1) or decrease lag handling by slowing the script less and later (higher value of no more than 1000) when it starts lagging.
WARNING: SETTING IT TOO LOW WILL CAUSE THE SCRIPT TO HAVE SERIOUS RESPONSE TIME ISSUES.

How much CPU would you allow the script to use for compression in percentage?
If you put over 100, then the script will run flat out. Make sure you have great cooling before doing this.

compressquality:20

How often the size command is ran on lrmloops. 
Note, when showhide=hide the size command is not ran at all except on startup.
The Size command is very resource intensive. Difference can be seen in the trim value.
So if you don't want it to run at all except on start-up, make it a higher value than the restarttime value.
When the size command is ran, lrmcapmax is set to 1, for that lrmloop only.
